/*!
 * Builds the linearized-Bellman LP subproblem for one SCP iteration (paper Fig. 5 / Eq. 30-38;
 * see the implementation plan for the full derivation).
 *
 * Everything that does not change between iterations (the affine decomposition, the row-group
 * structure, Prob0/Prob1, the parameter bounds, the threshold) is fixed at construction; encode()
 * is a pure function of the current linearization point and trust region radius, rebuilding the
 * LP from scratch on every call (no incremental/warm-started LP for V1, see the plan).
 *
 * IMPORTANT -- the Bellman inequality direction (and hence which Prob0/Prob1 qualitative pair the
 * caller must supply) depends on ThresholdDirection, by LP duality:
 *
 *   AtMost:  "p_s >= rhs - tau_s" for every action, objective MINIMIZES p_{s_I}
 *            -> converges to the *least supersolution* = Pmax, tightly, as the accuracy-preserving
 *               choice for that extremal. Caller must supply the Pmax-qualitative pair
 *               (performProb01Max for an Mdp, performProb01 for a Dtmc).
 *   AtLeast: "p_s <= rhs + tau_s" for every action, objective MAXIMIZES p_{s_I}
 *            -> converges to the *greatest subsolution* = Pmin, tightly. Caller must supply the
 *               Pmin-qualitative pair (performProb01Min for an Mdp, performProb01 for a Dtmc).
 *
 * Getting this backwards (e.g. always using ">=" regardless of direction) does not just compute
 * the wrong extremal -- for the direction that then pairs a "maximize" objective with a
 * lower-bound-only constraint, p_{s_I} becomes free to inflate to its own trust-region ceiling
 * with zero cost, completely independent of what the parameters actually support: a
 * self-consistent-looking but meaningless LP solution. The pairing above is load-bearing, not an
 * arbitrary convention.

     * @param zeroStates States with known value 0: Prob0 (probability property) or Rew0, i.e. the
     * target states themselves (reward property). Excluded from LP-variable creation; contribute
     * nothing when a successor.
     * @param oneStates States with known value 1: Prob1 (probability property only -- pass an
     * empty BitVector for a reward property, which has no such state). Excluded from LP-variable
     * creation; when a successor, contribute their exact affine transition value (never
     * linearized, since multiplying by the *known constant* 1 introduces no bilinear term).

     * an empty BitVector for a probability property). Excluded from LP-variable creation and from
     * having a Bellman constraint built for them; by construction of `excludedRows` below, never
     * actually referenced as a successor of any row this encoder builds a constraint for.
     * @param excludedRows Rows to skip entirely when building Bellman constraints, beyond the
     * per-state exclusion above -- needed because a reward property's "value known" classification
     * is graph-based per *state*, but an individual action (row) of an otherwise-included MDP
     * state can still lead to an infiniteStates successor and must be excluded on its own (an MDP
     * state can have both safe and unsafe actions; a DTMC state cannot, so this is always empty
     * for DTMCs). Pass an all-clear BitVector (sized to the total row count) for a probability
     * property, which has no such case.
     * @param initialState The state whose value is compared against the threshold. Must not be a
     * zero/one/infinite state -- callers should short-circuit before building an LP in that
     * degenerate case, since the answer is then already known without solving anything.
     * @param parameterBounds The (lower, upper) bound of each parameter (i.e. the outer search
     * region -- the trust region is intersected with this, never outside it).
